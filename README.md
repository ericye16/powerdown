powerdown
=========
This repo is the (future) home of powerdown, a small internet-based application that will allow stakeholers to determine how much of their energy bill is spent on heating and cooling. Homeowners, unit owners, building owners, can compare their expenditures with others in similar residences, and find suggestions for green renewals of their residences based on past succeses. 

GNU creative commons lisence should be implied, but in case it's not, here's us saying so.
